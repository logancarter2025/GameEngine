# Game Artificial Intelligence

This project introduces an artificial intelligence system designed to outperform users in a range of two-player games. It employs predictive behavior to determine the best move at each turn. Furthermore, thanks to its modular design, adding new games to the existing library is straightforward.


## Run Locally

To initiate the program, execute main.py. Upon starting, you'll be prompted to select a game to play. Each game will provide instructions on how to make your moves. The decision of who plays first will be made randomly for each game. After completing a game, a prompt will appear, allowing you to choose between starting a new game or exiting the program.
## Roadmap

-  Expand the engine's capabilities to include additional games against the user, such as:
    1. Checkers
    2. Reversi
